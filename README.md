# Pixels
An artwork which draws pixels on the screen, creating a beautiful image. Written in D with the arsd library.

Download this source code along with the arsd library which can be found here: https://github.com/adamdruppe/arsd.

Then just compile it using the DMD compiler and the command "dmd pixels -m64 -i -J. -O".

Run it and watch the magic happen on the screen.
